    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're having a Maker Yard Sale fundraiser! On <em>Wednesday Mar 27th</em>, we invite you to bring any "junk" you have from home that might be useful to someone else, and sell it at our community yard sale.</p>

<p>You can also bring a "skill" to be auctioned off at the event--if you're a potter, or an electronics guy, or a software gal, or if you know a thing or two about 3D printers, for example, you could offer your expertise to fellow makers. Contact canadaduane@gmail.com if you're willing to mentor someone for an evening and help fund the makerspace.</p>

<p>All proceeds will go toward buying a liability insurance policy--in other words, we'll be able to start stocking the space with probably-not-too-dangerous but still-needs-a-liability-policy type equipment like laser cutters and milling machines!</p>
